# Every Word Bot

**Step 1** — You need a VPS to host and run this script. I religiously recommend [DigitalOcean droplet](https://verfasor.com/DO/). I think you'll get a 50USD or 100USD credit on DigitalOcean when you sign-up with the link I shared. You could check Amazon AWS or Google Cloud Platform also. Select Debian, Ubuntu, or CentOS while you're creating a droplet or instance.

**Step 2** — [Install Python 3](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-python-3-7-on-ubuntu-18-04/) followed by the modules *facebook*, *tweepy*, and *schedule*. Installing modules will get fairly easy once you get the hang of it. (`pip3 install modulename`)

**Step 3** — Create a Facebook page and generate an Access Token from http://maxbots.ddns.net/token/. Paste the token to the accesstoken field in the script.

**Step 4** — Create a Twitter app and generate tokens & secret keys. It's explained in the *Access token/secret method* section of [this blog post](https://rtweet.info/articles/auth.html). 

**Step 5** — Download the [English words data-set](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) of your choice. Replace the words.txt in my repo with the text set of yours. Fire up the script with the command `sudo python3 main.py`

You can use [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) to manage the sessions.
